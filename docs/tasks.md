15. [ ] Implement code coverage reporting and set minimum coverage thresholds
16. [ ] Add performance tests for critical components and functions

## Code Quality and Organization

17. [ ] Review and refactor the interceptors in acontplus-ui-components (should these be in the utils library?)
18. [ ] Implement consistent error handling across all services
19. [ ] Refactor any duplicate code between the two libraries
20. [ ] Enforce strict TypeScript checks and fix any type issues
21. [ ] Implement consistent naming conventions across all files and components
22. [ ] Add input validation to all components and services
23. [ ] Refactor large components into smaller, more focused components
24. [ ] Review and optimize circular dependencies

## Build and Deployment Improvements

25. [ ] Set up continuous integration (CI) pipeline for automated testing and building
26. [ ] Implement semantic versioning for both libraries
27. [ ] Create a release process with automated changelog generation
28. [ ] Optimize bundle size by implementing tree-shaking and code splitting
29. [ ] Set up automated dependency updates with security checks
30. [ ] Implement build caching to improve build times
31. [ ] Create a staging environment for testing releases before production
32. [ ] Add source maps for easier debugging in development

## Performance Improvements

33. [ ] Implement lazy loading for large components in the test-app
34. [ ] Optimize change detection strategies in Angular components
35. [ ] Review and optimize memory usage in services and components
36. [ ] Implement virtual scrolling for large data sets in tables
37. [ ] Add performance monitoring and reporting
38. [ ] Optimize CSS and reduce unused styles
39. [ ] Implement caching strategies for API calls and expensive computations
40. [ ] Review and optimize Angular dependency injection

## Accessibility Enhancements

41. [ ] Audit all UI components for accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)
42. [ ] Add ARIA attributes to all interactive elements
43. [ ] Ensure proper keyboard navigation for all components
44. [ ] Implement focus management for modals and dialogs
45. [ ] Add high contrast mode support
46. [ ] Ensure all components work with screen readers
47. [ ] Add accessibility testing to the CI pipeline
48. [ ] Create accessibility documentation and guidelines

## Feature Enhancements

49. [ ] Implement internationalization (i18n) support for all UI components
50. [ ] Add theme customization options beyond light/dark mode
51. [ ] Create a component showcase in the test-app for all UI components
52. [ ] Implement responsive design for all components
53. [ ] Add animation and transition effects for better user experience
54. [ ] Implement form validation utilities and components
55. [ ] Add data visualization components (charts, graphs)
56. [ ] Create a design system with consistent tokens and variables

## Architecture Improvements

57. [ ] Review and optimize the dependency structure between the two libraries
58. [ ] Implement a monorepo management tool (Nx or Lerna) for better workspace management
59. [ ] Create a clear separation of concerns between the two libraries
60. [ ] Implement a state management solution for complex state
61. [ ] Define clear module boundaries and public APIs
62. [ ] Create a plugin architecture for extensibility
63. [ ] Implement feature flags for gradual feature rollout
64. [ ] Review and optimize the build configuration for both libraries
