#### 5.2 Resource Optimization
**Rationale:** Efficient resource usage improves application performance and reduces costs.
- Review and optimize memory usage in services and components
- Optimize CSS and reduce unused styles
- Implement caching strategies for API calls and expensive computations

#### 5.3 Performance Monitoring
**Rationale:** Performance monitoring helps identify and address issues proactively.
