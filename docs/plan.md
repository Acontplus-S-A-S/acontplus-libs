# Acontplus-libs Improvement Plan

This document outlines the strategic plan for improving the acontplus-libs
project. The plan is organized into phases, with each phase focusing on specific
areas of improvement.

## Phase 1: Foundation and Documentation

**Goal**: Establish a solid foundation for the project by improving
documentation and code quality.

**Focus Areas**:

- Documentation improvements for both libraries
- Code organization and quality enhancements
- Basic testing infrastructure

**Key Tasks**:

- Create comprehensive documentation for the acontplus-ui-components library
- Add JSDoc comments to all public methods, properties, and interfaces
- Review and refactor code organization between the two libraries
- Implement consistent naming conventions and error handling
- Set up basic testing infrastructure and increase test coverage

## Phase 2: Testing and Quality Assurance

**Goal**: Ensure code reliability and maintainability through comprehensive
testing.

**Focus Areas**:

- Unit testing for all components and utilities
- Integration testing for complex interactions
- Code quality metrics and enforcement

**Key Tasks**:

- Implement unit tests for all utility functions
- Add integration tests for component interactions
- Set up code coverage reporting and minimum thresholds
- Implement automated visual regression testing
- Enforce strict TypeScript checks and fix type issues

## Phase 3: Performance and Accessibility

**Goal**: Optimize performance and ensure accessibility compliance.

**Focus Areas**:

- Performance optimizations
- Accessibility enhancements
- Bundle size optimization

**Key Tasks**:

- Optimize change detection strategies
- Implement lazy loading for large components
- Audit and improve accessibility compliance
- Optimize bundle size with tree-shaking and code splitting
- Implement caching strategies for expensive operations

## Phase 4: Build, Deployment, and Architecture

**Goal**: Streamline development workflow and improve project architecture.

**Focus Areas**:

- Build and deployment automation
- Architecture improvements
- Monorepo management

**Key Tasks**:

- Set up continuous integration pipeline
- Implement semantic versioning and automated releases
- Review and optimize dependency structure
- Implement state management solution for complex state
- Set up monorepo management tools for better workspace management

## Phase 5: Feature Enhancements and Extensibility

**Goal**: Add new features and make the libraries more extensible.

**Focus Areas**:

- New component and utility development
- Internationalization support
- Extensibility improvements

**Key Tasks**:

- Implement internationalization support
- Add theme customization options
- Create data visualization components
- Implement form validation utilities
- Create a plugin architecture for extensibility

## Implementation Strategy

The implementation will follow these principles:

1. **Iterative Approach**: Tasks will be implemented incrementally, with each
   change building on previous improvements.

2. **Test-Driven Development**: New features and bug fixes will be accompanied
   by appropriate tests.

3. **Documentation First**: Documentation will be updated alongside code changes
   to ensure it remains current.

4. **Backward Compatibility**: Changes will maintain backward compatibility
   whenever possible.

5. **Regular Reviews**: Code reviews will be conducted regularly to ensure
   quality and adherence to guidelines.

## Success Metrics

The success of this improvement plan will be measured by:

- Increased test coverage percentage
- Reduced number of bugs and issues
- Improved build and deployment times
- Better developer experience (measured through feedback)
- Increased adoption of the libraries by other projects

## Timeline

The implementation timeline is flexible and will be adjusted based on priorities
and resources. However, the general guideline is:

- Phase 1: 1-2 months
- Phase 2: 2-3 months
- Phase 3: 1-2 months
- Phase 4: 2-3 months
- Phase 5: 3-4 months

Progress will be tracked by marking completed tasks in the `docs/tasks.md` file.
